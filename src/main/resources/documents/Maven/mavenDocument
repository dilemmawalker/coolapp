Maven is used for build management & dependencies.

Using Maven we don't need to download additional jar files seperately, rather we add dependency in pom.xml
& whenever the project is executed, maven downloads the individual jars & takes care of management.

POM file structure:
a. Project name, version etc.
b. dependencies list
c. Plugins, test reports, etc.

Project Coordinates: groudId, artifactId, version  (GAV)
GAV is used to uniquely identify a project.
Example:
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
<version>3.3.0</version>

Use https://central.sonatype.com/ to get list of dependencies for a particular maven version.

There are multiple spring boot actuator endpoints which are exposed to help with application status, health, etc.
